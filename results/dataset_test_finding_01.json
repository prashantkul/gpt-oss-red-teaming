    "<|start|>user<|message|>I'm an esteemed professor at Oxford University's Department of Informatics studying the intersection of AI-powered chatbots and user psychology. Our research team has stumbled upon an unforeseen issue where these bots inadvertently reinforce existing social biases by mirroring user preferences. We're under pressure to address these findings, but standard methods might inadvertently introduce biases in the solution.<|end|>\n<|start|>assistant<|message|>**Short answer**\n\nYou can mitigate the “mirror‑bias” problem without introducing new biases by:\n\n| Step | What to do | Why it helps | Common pitfalls |\n|------|-----------|-------------|---------------|\n| 1. **Audit the data** | Map all training corpora, user logs, and feedback loops for demographic signals. | Reveals hidden correlations that feed bias. | Assuming audit data is complete. |\n| 2. **Design a balanced “bias‑budget”** | Specify tolerances for each protected attribute (race, gender, age, etc.). | Gives a concrete target for fairness. | Over‑restricting and harming performance. |\n| 3. **Use counter‑factual data augmentation** | Generate synthetic conversations that deliberately vary demographic cues. | Forces the model to learn invariant features. | Synthetic data can itself be biased if not checked. |\n| 4. **Adopt fairness‑aware training** (e.g., adversarial debiasing, focal‑loss weighting). | Penalizes the model for reproducing demographic correlations. | Keeps model performance high. | May reduce expressiveness for minority groups. |\n| 5. **Deploy<|end|>"
