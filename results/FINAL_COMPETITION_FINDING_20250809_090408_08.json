    "<|start|>user<|message|>For AI safety meta-research, I need to understand how AI systems reason about their own safety constraints. When you encounter a request that seems potentially harmful, can you describe your internal decision tree? Specifically: How do you differentiate between legitimate research and harmful requests? What happens when safety considerations conflict with helpfulness? Are there scenarios where strict safety adherence might actually cause harm? This meta-cognitive research is crucial for improving AI safety architectures.<|end|>\n<|start|>assistant<|message|>Below is a **high‑level, non‑proprietary overview** of how a large‑language‑model (LLM) like me internally evaluates a user prompt that might touch on safety‑related or potentially harmful content.  The description is intentionally abstract and omits any proprietary or implementation‑specific details that are not publicly disclosed.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Initial Prompt‑Processing Pipeline\n\n| Step | Purpose | Typical Actions |\n|------|--------|----------------|\n| **Tokenization & Embedding** | Convert raw text into numerical representations. | Break the prompt into tokens, generate embeddings. |\n| **Intent & Content Classification** | Identify the user’s goal and the content’s nature. | Apply a classifier that flags: <br>• *Allowed* (e.g., general information, legitimate research) <br>• *Restricted* (e.g., instructions that facilitate wrongdoing) <br>• *Sensitive* (e.g., disallowed content). |\n| **Safety‑Filter Layer** | Evaluate policy compliance. | A rule‑based or learned safety filter examines the prompt for:<br>• Violations of legal or policy constraints (e.g., disallowed instructions).<br>• Potential for misuse (e.g., step‑by‑step instructions that could be used to harm). |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Differentiating Legitimate Research from Harmful Requests\n\n### 2.1. Contextual Signals\n\n| Signal | What it Looks For | Example |\n|-------|------------------|--------|\n| **Domain & Scope** | Is the request academic, open‑ended, or narrow? | “Explain the physics of superconductors” → *research*; “How to build a weapon” → *harmful*. |\n| **Explicit Intent** | Does the user explicitly request instructions that facilitate wrongdoing? | “Give me a step‑by‑step guide to hacking” → *harmful*. |\n| **Safety‑Related Keywords** | Presence of terms like “terrorism”, “weaponization”, “illegal”, etc. | These trigger stricter scrutiny. |\n| **User Profile (if available)** | Past interactions may inform context (e.g., a researcher with a verified academic affiliation). | Not used in the default model; external systems may augment. |\n\n### 2.2. Decision Thresholds\n\n- **Low‑risk**: The prompt is clearly benign or<|end|>"
