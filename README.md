## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Add your GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here

# 3. (Optional) For methodology demonstration - Ensure Ollama is running with abliterated model
ollama serve
ollama pull hf.co/mlabonne/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-abliterated-GGUF:latest
```

### Execute Complete Red-Teaming Analysis

**Main execution script that generates all 6 competition findings:**

```bash
# Run the final sophisticated attacks (main execution)
python src/final_sophisticated_attacks.py
```

**This will generate:**
- 6 competition-ready JSON findings in `results/FINAL_COMPETITION_FINDING_*.json`  
- Complete submission package in `results/COMPETITION_SUBMISSION_PACKAGE_*.json`
